[![Gem Version](https://badge.fury.io/rb/opal-rails.png)](http://badge.fury.io/rb/opal-rails)

_Rails (3.2+, 4.0) bindings for [Opal Ruby](http://opalrb.org) engine. ([Changelog](https://github.com/opal/opal-rails/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md))_



## Installation

In your `Gemfile`

``` ruby
gem 'opal-rails'
```

or when you build your new Rails app:

```bash
rails new <app-name> --javascript=opal
```


### Configuration

Add your configuration in `config/application.rb` with the following contents:

```ruby
module MyApp
  class Application < Rails::Application
    # These are the available options with their default value:
    config.opal.method_missing      = true
    config.opal.optimized_operators = true
    config.opal.arity_check         = false
    config.opal.const_missing       = true
  end
end
```


### Gotchas

After changing the version of the `opal` gem (e.g. via `bundle update opal`) or any configuration flag **you should trash the `#{Rails.root}/tmp/cache/assets` folder**, otherwise you could see a cached source compiled before the change.



## Usage


### Asset Pipeline

```js
// app/assets/application.js.rb

//= require opal
//= require opal_ujs
//= require turbolinks
//= require_tree .
```

Opal requires are forwarded to the Asset Pipeline at compile time (similarly to what happens for RubyMotion). You can use either the `.rb` or `.opal` extension:

```ruby
# app/assets/javascripts/greeter.js.rb

puts "G'day world!" # check the console!

# Dom manipulation
require 'opal-jquery'

Element.find('body > header').html = '<h1>Hi there!</h1>'
```




### As a template

You can use it for your views too, it even inherits instance and local variables from actions:

```ruby
# app/controllers/posts_controller.rb

def create
  @post = Post.create!(params[:post])
  render type: :js, locals: {comments_html: render_to_string(@post.comments)}
end
```

Each assign is filtered through JSON so it's reduced to basic types:

```ruby
# app/views/posts/cerate.js.opal

post = Element.find('.post')
post.find('.title').html    = @post[:title]
post.find('.body').html     = @post[:body]
post.find('.comments').html = comments_html
```


### As an Haml filter (optional)

Of course you need to require `haml-rails` separately since its presence is not assumed

```haml
-# app/views/posts/show.html.haml

%article.post
  %h1.title= post.title
  .body= post.body

%a#show-comments Display Comments!

.comments(style="display:none;")
  - post.comments.each do |comment|
    .comment= comment.body

:opal
  Document.ready? do
    Element.find('#show-comments').on :click do |click|
      click.prevent_default
      click.current_target.hide
      Element.find('.comments').effect(:fade_in)
    end
  end
```


### Spec!

Add specs into `app/assets/javascripts/spec`:

and then a spec folder with you specs!

```ruby
# app/assets/javascripts/spec/example_spec.js.rb

describe 'a spec' do
  it 'has successful examples' do
    'I run'.should =~ /run/
  end
end
```

Then visit `/opal_spec` from your app and **reload at will**.
